Cook for 8-10 mins, until tender, while you continue.\\n3. Heat 2 tbsp of oil in a large frying pan. Gently fry the onion for 5 mins, stirring now and then. Increase the heat, add the mushrooms and cook for 4 mins, until starting to soften.\\n4. Drain the cooked potatoes, then transfer them back to their saucepan. Set aside for now. Drain and rinse the lentils.\\n5. Stir the garlic and Greek spice pot into the mushrooms.\\nPour in the wine. Let it bubble and reduce by 1/2. Add the lentils and passata.
