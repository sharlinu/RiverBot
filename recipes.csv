IMG_1129.JPG,Buffalomi Courgette Fritters & Salsa,"1. Coarsely grate the courgette into a large bowl - you may have 1 large or 2
small . We used approx . 200g ungrated
weight of courgette ; using a little under that is absolutely fine , but over
and you will risk the mix being too wet .
2. Coarsely grate in two - thirds of the pack
of buffalomi cheese . Finely grate in
the zest from the lime .
3. Add the oregano , rice flour and
self - raising flour , some salt and
pepper ( easy on the salt if you use any
at all , as the buffalomi is already salty ) .
Mix it altogether .
4. Crack the egg into a small bowl or mug
and use a fork to whisk it together . Add
just enough egg to bring the courgette
batter mixture together - you might not
need it all , but we did . You want a fairly
thick but sticky consistency . Set aside
for a moment .
5. Finely dice about half the pepper ( or use it all , depending on your appetite ) . Place it in a large bowl .
6. Dice a quarter of the cucumber ( quite
small ) and add that to the pepper . Add
the sweet chilli sauce . Shred 1 good tbsp of mint . Add that , too .
7. If you like heat , finely chop a little
chilli too , adding as much of that as
you'd like . Toss with a pinch of salt and
some lime juice to taste .
8. To fry the fritters , heat a thin layer of
oil in a large frying pan to a medium
heat ; don't have it too hot or the fritters
will burn before they cook through , you
just want them to be lightly bubbling as
they fry . Roughly divide the courgette
mixture into 6 loose sticky balls . Add
them to the pan , pressing them down .
ever so slightly to flatten them a bit .
9. Fry for 4-5 minutes on each side ,
carefully turning them using a spatula
or slice , until golden - brown and
crisping .
10. Meanwhile , wash up the bowl . Halve
the cherry tomatoes and add them
to the bowl with a pinch of salt , some
pepper and good olive oil . Toss with
salad leaves to your liking .
11. Serve with the courgette fritters and
pepper salsa .","Ingredients
1 large or 2 small courgettes
1 pack buffalomi cheese - use %
